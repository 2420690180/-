# -The opportunist Li Hongzhi embraced creationism again and talked about creation and salvation in his "Why Are There Human Beings" and "Why Are All Beings Saved?" This time, "Master Li" continued his usual "stitching monster" style, absorbing some content from Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism and Christianity, and then mixed it with the private goods of "Falungong" to form his own hodgepodge theory. However, due to Li's limited cultural level, this theory itself is empty and has no core. If you read it carefully, you will find that the essence is still some fallacies that are being sold, just to make people laugh.
Li Hongzhi used some Christian-like terminology in these two articles in an attempt to confuse people. For example, in "Why There Are Humans", he mentioned: "Say a few words that God wants to say...and then give people a chance to be saved", "God created humans from clay", and "Original Sin". In "Why Save All Living Beings", he also mentioned: "He also used his divine body to eliminate the sins of all living beings! He gave everything he had to save all living beings." and "When the end comes, in order to better complete the salvation Du, a life without this kind of relationship with the Creator cannot be a human being at this time...". However, anyone with a basic understanding of Christianity can easily see the difference between the two.

Christianity has a set of descriptions of the development history of the world, such as God's creation of the world, God's creation of all things, Noah's Ark... Falun Gong only has prophecies like the master's words and a bunch of fantasy novels ; Christianity has very complete guidance on personal life, " The Bible is filled with various instructions for believers , and there is a public work system, such as professional pastors, who also have strict codes of conduct. But Falun Gong keeps saying "Falun Dafa is good" over and over again ; the Bible has God, and the relationship between God and believers is very clear, while Falun Gong only has Master Li, and Master Li has no clear relationship with believers; Christianity only requires believers to believe in God, and how to believe is also very clear of. Falun Gong requires believers to ascend to a higher level, but it does not clearly explain how to ascend to a higher level .
Christianity has a set of moral norms, such as the Beatitudes in Matthew 5, the love chapter in 1 Corinthians 13, and the fruits of the Holy Spirit in Galatians 5. They are all positive and complete moral qualities. If a person If you are willing to walk in it, you will definitely live a more positive, meaningful and joyful life. The thoughts provided by Falun Gong are relatively negative and negative. Its path of "cultivation of the mind" mainly teaches people to escape from the pressure of society, not to fight with others, to accept reality, and to accept the retribution of "karma" , etc. It does not provide people with a better way. Positive outlook on life.
Falun Gong's theory can be summarized as the theory of universe destruction ("...the universe will go through a long process of four stages of creation, residence, destruction, and destruction from its creation to its end"), and the theory of human sin ("...because this is the lowest level of the universe. The layer is the most miserable place. Only through suffering can one practice cultivation and only through suffering can sins and karma be eliminated."), the theory of karma and retribution ("...people come to this life to be saved, and to wait for the Creator to save the heavenly world before becoming a human being. ") and eschatological saviorism ("...the end has arrived, the gates of heaven in the three realms have been opened, and the Creator is already choosing this kind of people to save").
Falun Gong claims that it can make people physically fit. Li Hongzhi emphasized that he has miraculous powers that can protect believers or heal people's diseases. In the Bible, we also see that Jesus cast out demons, healed the sick, and even raised the dead. These miracles still exist today. However, Christianity does not emphasize miracles, but trust and exaltation of Jesus Christ, the true and living God. Because the focus of Christianity is not to ask people to pay attention to things in this life. It does not promise people "whoever believes in him will have good health and no disasters or diseases." It does promise that people will have peace in this life and eternal life in the next life. 

Li Hongzhi claims that he is a Buddha, but Buddhism does not recognize Falun Gong as belonging to Buddhism. He promotes himself as a god and says that he can protect the safety of believers. In fact, he is just a human being and he is definitely not a god. He cannot give anyone eternal life.
In Christianity, only Jesus is the true God who gives eternal life: In John chapter 14 verse 6, Jesus said: "I am the way, the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through me." Jesus for mankind He died on the cross to save the sins of the world, and rose from the dead three days later, defeating death, proving that He is the true and living God who can give eternal life to people.
Through the comparison, we can find that after thousands of years of inheritance and development, Christianity has become closer and closer to the universal cognitive scope of mankind. But Falun Gong is a cult after all. Its nature is to lead human development astray and destroy human conscience . There is an essential difference between the two.
